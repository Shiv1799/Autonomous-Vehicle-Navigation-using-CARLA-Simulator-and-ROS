# Project Description

This project implements an autonomous vehicle navigation system in a simulated urban environment using the CARLA Simulator and ROS. The system uses sensor data and control signals to enable a vehicle to navigate through traffic and reach a destination autonomously.




# Requirements for the Project
1. [Carla Simulator](https://carla.org/) : To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries.
2. [ROS](https://www.ros.org/): Popular open-source middleware for building robotic systems.
3. Sensor and Control Libraries
4. Path Planning and Control Libraries
5. Deep Learning Libraries (optional)
6. Visualization Libraries: RViz

# Tasks in Pipeline

- [ ] Setting up the Environment and Basic Control
- [ ] Sensor Data Acquisition and Processing
- [ ] Path Planning
- [ ] Advanced Control
- [ ] Integration and Testing
- [ ] Advanced Features (Optional)
