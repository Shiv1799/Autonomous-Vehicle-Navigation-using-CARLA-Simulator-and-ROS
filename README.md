# Autonomous-Vehicle-Navigation-using-CARLA-Simulator-and-ROS
The main objective of this project is to use the CARLA simulator and ROS to develop an autonomous vehicle navigation system in a simulated urban environment. The system will use sensor data and control signals to enable a vehicle to navigate through traffic and reach a destination autonomously.
