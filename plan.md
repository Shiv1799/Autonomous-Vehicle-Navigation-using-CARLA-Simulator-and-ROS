# Week 1 Setting up the Environment and Basic Control
1 . Install and configure the CARLA Simulator and ROS on your computer.
2 . Familiarize yourself with the CARLA Simulator and ROS environment and learn how to control the vehicle using basic commands.
Implement basic control algorithms for the vehicle, such as a simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, to keep it moving in a straight line.
# Week 2: Sensor Data Acquisition and Processing
3. Add sensors to the vehicle, such as a LIDAR, camera, and GPS, and learn how to read data from them using ROS.
4. Process the sensor data to obtain useful information, such as the position and orientation of the vehicle and its surroundings.
# Week 3: Path Planning
5. Implement a path planning algorithm, such as A* or RRT, to generate a path from the current position of the vehicle to a designated destination.
6. Develop a method for updating the path in real time to account for changes in the environment.
# Week 4: Advanced Control
7. Implement an advanced control algorithm, such as model predictive control (MPC), to control the vehicle's steering and acceleration/deceleration along the planned path.
8. Tune the control parameters to optimize the vehicle's performance.
# Week 5: Integration and Testing
9. Integrate the various components of the system, including the sensor data acquisition and processing, path planning, and advanced control algorithms.
10. Test the system in the CARLA Simulator and refine the algorithms as necessary to improve performance and stability.
# Week 6: Advanced Features (Optional)
11. Implement additional features, such as obstacle avoidance, traffic rules adherence, and real-time object detection using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
12. Refine the features to improve the system's performance and robustness.
